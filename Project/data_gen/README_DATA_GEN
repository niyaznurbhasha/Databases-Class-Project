We first used a service called generatedata to produce 10,000 unique email addresses and strings for user passwords, as well as to produce 
thousands of different cities across the United States, along with their states. This list of unique emails was necessary to create
realistic data for all the relations in our database. Moreover, with all the data being randomly produced for the Users Relation,
we were able to create a representative population of users in our database whose information was randomly generated. 

There were many variables whose values were chosen randomly from a list created by us in Python. For example, we produced a possible range
of outcomes for variables like the User's interests, the names of the Projects, the project's current and goal capacity, and many others.
Using the csv package in python, we wrote through all the relations and chose values for each variable randomly through the random.choice()
function. 

The testing process helped identify many smaller problems that existed with the original dataset production. Through diagnosing our errors,
we were able to produce a realistic dataset that would run properly given the constraints outlined by our database.
